"""
This script is part of the chia_plot_manager set of scripts.

Script to help automate the addition of new hard drives
to a Chia NAS/Harvester. PLease make sure you understand
everything that this script does before using it!

This script is intended to make my life easier. It is ONLY
designed to 1) work with unformatted drives with no existing
partitions, and 2) utilizing the directory structure found
in the readme.

This script WILL NOT work if you are utilizing hard drives wiht
no partitions as we would have no way to determine if the drive
is newly added.

It can be modified, of course, to do other things.

1) Looks for any drive device that is on the system but does not
end in a '1'. For example: /dev/sda1 vs. /dev/sdh - In this case
/dev/sdh has no partition so it likely is not mounted or being
used.

2) Utilizing the directory structure that I have shared in the
main readme, locate the next available mountpoint to use.

3) Utilizing sgdisk, creates a new GPT partition on the new
drive.

4) Formats the drive with the xfs filesystem.

5) Verifies that the UUID of the drive does not already exist
in /etc/fstab and if not, adds the correct entry to /etc/fstab.

6) Mounts the new drive

7) Add the new mountpoint to your chia harvester configuration.
